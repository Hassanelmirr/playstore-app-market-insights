# playstore-app-market-insights
Exploratory data analysis and visualization of Google Play Store apps. Includes overall market insights, a deep dive into Education apps, and a comparative study against other categories.

## Project Overview 
This project was completed as part of my internship with Xpertbot. The goal was to analyze the Google Play Store app market, with a special focus on Education apps, in order to extract market insights, understand financing strategies, and provide recommendations for Xpertbot’s own education app.

The analysis was conducted using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in Jupyter Notebook, following a data storytelling approach.

## Objectives
- Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean and prepare the dataset.  
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and compute descriptive statistics.  
- Visualize key insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.  
- Build a dashboard-style Jupyter Notebook to summarize findings.  
- Provide actionable insights about the Education app ecosystem.

## Key Analyses

1. Dataset Cleaning & Preparation
  -Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.
  -Creating derived features (e.g., avg_installs, released_year).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  -App categories, free vs paid distribution.
  -Ratings and installs distribution.
  -Play Store recommendations.

3. Education Apps Deep Dive
  -Market size and trends.
  -Free vs paid education apps.
  -Monetization models (ads, in-app purchases, hybrid).
  -Top developers and release trends.

4. Final Comparative Analysis
  -Free vs Paid performance.
  -Financing strategy effectiveness (Ads, IAP, Paid, Hybrid).
  -Benchmarking top education apps (e.g., Duolingo, Photomath, Brainly).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 
- Pandas → data cleaning & manipulation  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly → visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook → interactive analysis and dashboard

## Key Insights

  - The Play Store is dominated by free apps (97% free vs 3% paid).
  Education apps are well-rated (avg ~4.2⭐), showing strong demand and satisfaction.
  - Free + Ads + IAP is the most effective monetization strategy, driving the highest installs.
  - Paid-only apps underperform in both installs and ratings compared to free apps.
  - For Xpertbot, launching as a free app with optional IAP (and limited ads) is the most sustainable strategy.

## Relevance
This project is directly relevant to the Education domain, aligning with the context of **Xpertbot**, an educational application that provides students with learning content and tests.
