## playstore-app-market-insights
Exploratory data analysis and visualization of Google Play Store apps. Includes overall market insights, a deep dive into Education apps, and a comparative study against other categories.

# Project Overview 
This project analyzes a dataset of over 1 million mobile applications from the Google Play Store.  
The goal is to extract insights about app popularity, quality, pricing models, and growth trends through Python data analysis and visualization.  

The analysis is structured into three main parts:
1. General Overview → Understanding the global Play Store landscape.  
2. Education Apps Deep Dive → Focusing on apps relevant to Xpertbot’s domain.  
3. Comparative Analysis → Benchmarking Education apps against other major categories (Games, Productivity, Tools).  

*(Optional Bonus: clustering apps into segments with K-means)*

# Objectives
- Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean and prepare the dataset.  
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and compute descriptive statistics.  
- Visualize key insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.  
- Build a dashboard-style Jupyter Notebook to summarize findings.  
- Provide actionable insights about the Education app ecosystem.

# Key Questions
- Which categories dominate the Play Store?  
- Do free apps get more installs than paid apps?  
- What are the key trends in Education apps?  
- How do Education apps compare to other categories like Games and Productivity?
